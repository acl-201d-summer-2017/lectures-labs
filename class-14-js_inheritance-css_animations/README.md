    * Everyone must contribute to all HTML, JS, and CSS
* Technical requirements:
    * CLEAN, DRY and well structured code
    * Data must persist on page reload
    * Use OOP to structure your code
    * An about the team page
* Tomorrow afternoon your team should have at least two ideas you're excited to work on. We'll discuss them and see which would be best for you to do!
    * Monday you will need to have a full proposal for the final project idea. More details about that tomorrow.

## Learning Objectives
- Create JavaScript objects that inherit properties using JavaScript prototype inheritance. 
- Add visually pleasing animations to a web page using CSS animations.

## Notes
* JS Inheritence
    * Every object in JS has a prototype - the Object object
    * **prototype**: "a first, typical or preliminary model of something, especially a machine, from which other forms are developed or copied."
    * A copy of the object's prototype is accessible through the `__proto__` property
    * The prototype chain: JS objects will look for properties on themselves first, then their prototypes
        * `Array.hasPropertyOf` comes from `Object.hasPropertyOf`
* CSS Animations
    * [CodePens you can learn from!](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/10-examples-of-animation-on-codepen-you-can-learn-from--cms-28244)
    * [MDN animatable properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties)
    * Transitions ~ when an element changes state: on hover
        * use `transition` css property on the element you want to animate
    * Keyframes ~ not tied to a state change
        * use `animation` property on the element you want to animate AND create `keyframes` block outlining the animation
