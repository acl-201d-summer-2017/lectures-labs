1. Announcements
1. Code review
1. JS Data Types and Control Flow
1. HTML and CSS
1. Lab Prep

#### Announcements:
 - Thanks for sticking around yesterday! Also, it was awesome to see y'all try your ideas/babel in code - that's what it takes to learn a new language. Keep doing it!
 - Quiz 1 will be published this afternoon, and it will be due by 11:59pm Wednesday. More about quizzes:
 	- There will be some quiz content from time to time that we may not have covered yet; for instance there is something in today's quiz that we do not cover until tomorrow.
 	- Keep in mind that you have unlimited re-takes on the quizzes, and that they are open-internet/ open-book. It's more about what you can figure out than what you have memorized.
	- Also, note that the quizzes have two main purposes:
  			1. To get you to re-engage with the content in a different way, reinforcing your knowledge.
  			2. To help you prepare for the Code 301 entrance exam, which you will take at the end of Week 3. There is a minimum threshold you must pass on that exam (70%), and also, that exam factors into your grade in this class.

## Learning Objectives
- Be able to identify and describe the JavaScript data types: booleans, strings, numbers (integers, floats), arrays.
- Store and access data using arrays.
- Control the flow of a script file using conditional statements.
- Lint a JavaScript file to check for syntax errors using EsLint.
- Understand the structure of an HTML file and tags including: `<DOCTYPE>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, and `<script>`
- Apply styling to an HTML element using CSS.
- Manage versions of a project using Git branches.
- Push and pull a Git repo to and from a remote GitHub repo.

    - Add `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`, `.gitignore`, and `.eslintrc` files
      - Markdown syntax
  - Read through the lab assignment, translate it into a to-do list, and fulfill some technical components such as:
    1. Create a basic scaffold for the project
    2. Use `if/else` statements to handle conditional logic
    3. Add in some basic input validation
    4. Utilize good Git processes including **a-c-p** cycles
