## Notes
* UI and UX
    * user interface
        * how the user can interact with the web page
        * goal of ui:
            - easy to use
            - easy to understand
            - effective for the end-goal (or product)
        * [goodui.org](http://www.goodui.org/)
        * remember those ol' alerts? [sweet alert](http://www.javascripting.com/view/sweetalert)
        * [5 examples we can learn from](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/bad-design-vs-good-design-5-examples-we-can-learn-frombad-design-vs-good-design-5-examples-we-can-learn-from-130706)
    * user experience
        * how the interactions and more affect the user's perception and experience
        * goal of ux:
            * influence user's perception of brand/product
        * encompasses many, many things:
            - onboarding
            - branding
            - content
            - ui
            - and more!

    * common practices you've seen in the wild
        - hamburger menu
            - pro: hides menu
            - con: hides menu, also not 100% intuitive
            - [example](https://theoutline.com/)
        - # of items in navigation
            - keep it between 5-7
            - [example](https://wordpress.com/)
            - [example - too many options](https://www.usatoday.com/)
        - links should look like links, or at least different from standard text
            - otherwise, why would you click?
            - [example](http://www.goodui.org/)
        - email sign up pop ups
          - show on switching to tab
          - show as little pop up on bottom
        - logging in with social media
        - hotkeys!!!
            - often forgotten as part of UI
            - [example](https://workflowy.com/)
* local storage
    * what is persistance?
    * localStorage = built in browser storage
        * **ONLY SAVES STRINGS**
        * **IS LOCAL!**
        * how to save to localStorage
        * how to get from localStorage
